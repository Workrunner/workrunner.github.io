By using a flowchart, a process can be visualized as a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points. By using a process matrix, it can be viewed as a sequence of activities with relevant rules based on data in the process.\n\n\nThere are three types of business processes:\n\n\n\n\nManagement processes\n are the processes that govern the operation of a system. Typical management processes include \"corporate governance\" and \"strategic management\".\n\n\nOperational processes\n are processes that constitute the core business and create the primary value stream. Typical operational processes are purchasing, manufacturing, advertising and marketing, and sales.\n\n\nSupporting processes\n are those which support the core processes. Examples include accounting, recruitment, call center, technical support.\n\n\n\n\nA business process begins with a target and ends, ideally, with the achievement of the business objective.

At the top bar, there is a search field that allows you to search the selected container for items that match a specified \nsearch\n keyword.\n\n\n\n\nWorkrunner system gives users various search options. There are:\n\n\nTerms\n\nTwo types of search term option is available.\n\n\n\n\nA Single Term is a single word such as \u201c purchase\u201d or \u201corder\u201d.\n\n\nA Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as \"purchase order\".\n\n\n\n\nFields\n\nYou can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon \n:\n and then the term you are looking for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to find the document entitled \"Purchase Order\" which contains the text \"order\", you can enter: \n\n\ntitle:\u201dPurchase Order\u201d AND text:go\n or \ntitle:\u201dPurchase Order\u201d AND order\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query\n\n\ntitle:invoice approval information\n \n\nwill only find \"purchase\" in the title field. It will find \"approval\" and \"information\" in the default field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWildcard Searches\n\nWorkrunner system supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries).\n\n\nTo perform a single character wildcard search use the \n?\n symbol.\n\n\nTo perform a multiple character wildcard search use the \n*\n symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for \"invoice\" or \"expense\" you can use the search:\n\n\ninvo?ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for expense or expenses you can use the search:\n\n\nexpense*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.\n\n\nexp*ense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You cannot use a \n*\n or \n?\n symbol as the first character of a search.\n\n\nFuzzy Searches\n\n\nWorkrunner system supports fuzzy searches. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, \n~\n, symbol at the end of a single word Term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo search for a term similar in spelling to \"expense\" use the fuzzy search:\n\n\nexpense~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value is between 0 and 1, with a value closer to 1 only terms with a higher similarity will be matched. For example:\n\n\nexpense~0,8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default that is used if the parameter is not given is 0.5.\n\n\nProximity Searches\n\nWorkrunner system supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To do a proximity search use the tilde, \n~\n, symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a \"form\" and \"expense\" within 10 words of each other in a document use the search:\n\n\n    \u201cexpense form\u201d~10\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Searches\n\nRange Queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query.\n\n\n\n\nRange Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically.\nMod_date:[300201 TO 300501]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will find documents whose mod_date fields have values between 300201 and 30050, inclusive.\n\n\n\n\nNote that Range Queries are not reserved for date fields. You could also use range queries with non-date fields:\nTitle:{Document TO Invoice}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will find all documents whose titles are between Document and Invoice, but not including Document and Invoice.\n\n\nInclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by curly brackets.\n\n\nBoosting a Term\n\nWorkrunner system provides the relevance level of matching documents based on the terms found. To boost a term use the caret, \n^\n, symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching. The higher the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be.\n\n\n\n\nBoosting allows you to control the relevance of a document by boosting its term. For example, if you are searching for\nexpense form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand you want the term \"expense\" to be more relevant boost it using the \n^\n symbol along with the boost factor next to the term. You would type:\n\n\n    expense^4 form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will make documents with the term expense appear more relevant. You can also boost Phrase Terms as in the example:\n \u201cexpense form\u201d^4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be positive, it can be less than 1.\n\n\nBoolean Operators\n\nBoolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Workrunnersystem supports \nAND\n, \n+\n, \nOR\n, \nNOT\n and \n-\n as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be \nALL CAPS\n).\n\n\nThe \nOR\n operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the \nOR\n operator is used. The \nOR\n operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in place of the word \nOR\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo search for documents that contain either \"expense form\" or just \"expense\" use the query:\n\n\n\u201cexpense form\u201d expense\n or \n\u201cexpense form\u201d OR expense\n\n\n\n\nAND operator\n\nThe \nAND\n operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol \n can be used in place of the word \nAND\n.\n\n\nTo search for documents that contain \"Expense form\" and \"Invoice form\" use the query:\n\n\n \u201cexpense form\u201d AND \u201cInvoice form\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n+ operator\n\nThe \n+\n or required operator requires that the term after the \n+\n symbol exist somewhere in a the field of a single document.\n\n\nTo search for documents that must contain \"expense\" and may contain \"form\" use the query:\n\n\n  +expense form\n\n\n\n\n\nNOT operator\n\nThe \nNOT\n operator excludes documents that contain the term after \nNOT\n. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used in place of the word \nNOT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo search for documents that contain\"purchase order\" but not \"expense form\" use the query:\n\n\n\u201cPurchase order\u201d NOT \u201cexpense form\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNOT\n operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results:\n\n\nNOT\u201dpurchase order\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-\n or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the \n-\n symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo search for documents that contain \u201cPurchase order\u201d but not \"\"expense form\" use the query:\n\n\n\u201cPurchase order\u201d - \u201cexpense form\u201d\n\n\nGrouping\n\nWorkrunner system supports using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.\n\n\nTo search for either \"expense\" or \"purchase\" and \"inbox\" use the query:\n\n\n(expense OR purchase) AND inbox\n\n\n\n\n\nField Grouping\n\nWorkrunner system supports using parentheses to group multiple clauses to a single field. To search for a title that contains both the word \"expense\" and the phrase \"purchase order\" use the query:\n\n\ntitle:(+expense+\u201dpurchase order\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\nEscaping Special Characters\n\nWorkrunner system  supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. The current list special characters are\n\n\n+ - \n || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ \n ~ * ? : \\\n\n\nTo escape these character use the  before the character. For example to search for \n(2+2):4\n use the query:\n\n\n\\(2\\+2\\)\\:4",

With a flexible architecture, it allows for rapid and frequent modifications to active processes and makes it easy to migrate older applications into service-oriented structures.\n\n\nOrganization\n\n\nOrganization in the Workrunner has a management structure that determines relationships between the different units, groups and the members. Also it assigns roles, responsibilities, and authority to carry out different tasks. \n\n\nProcess Modelling\n\n\nProcess modelling is the analytical representation and illustration in the Workrunner. Process modeling is used to map out a system\u2019s current processes to create a baseline for process improvements and to design future processes with those improvements incorporated. A process model is completely an anticipation of what the process will look like.\n\n\nBackground Jobs\n\n\nA background job is a the Workrunner job that runs behind the scenes and without any user interaction. Typical tasks for these processes include logging, system monitoring, scheduling, and user notification.\n\n\nKey Concepts\n\n\nThis page introduces some of key concepts related to designing a business process with Workrunner and terminology used.\n\n\nProcess\n\n\nPut simply, a process is a way of doing your work. It's a structured way of organizing activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product.\n\n\nFor example: When your computer is malfunctioning you may call a technical guy on the phone and wait for him to come over, or you may start Incident Request process that is automatically assigned to the relevant technical person and instantly trace the current status of your request.\n\n\nUsing a clearly-defined process flow saves you from chaos while doing your work. All of your daily business activities can ultimately be defined as a process.\n\n\nIn Workrunner everything you do is about starting a new process or completing an assigned task from your inbox. Even defining a new user or terminating a workflow instance is controlled by a process.\n\n\nFolder\n\n\nProcesses are categorized in a security controlled \nfolders\n. Folders are generally used to access start points of process or reporting business data. Folders can be contain other folders to build a hierarchical organization. You can create new folders any time or automatically created when you install a process from app store.\n\n\nProcess Definition\n\n\nIn Workrunner everything you define, stored in a process definition in a XML format. Process definition contains the all of required information (diagram, databases, reports, web service connections) to run. Process definitions are also versioned under processes for switch to different versions of process any time.\n\n\nBusiness Data\n\n\nEvery process exists to produce a result. In Workrunner from beginning to end result of process transported in XML format called as \ndata model\n. Data model may contain unlimited fields and lists. You can also store more complex data structures like hierarchies.\n\n\nGenerally business data is empty when workflow is started but while workflow advances data is filled by people or integrated systems.\n\n\nWork List\n\n\nWork List\n is a list of work items that assigned to people. Work items are filtered by tags to distinguish for easy access.  All of new assigned work items are tagged with \"Inbox\" but you can remove it to review later. Until work item is complete by you or another user all of waiting work items are tagged with \"All Waiting\" and you cant remove this tag. When you complete a work item its tagged with \"Sent\" tag. If you need to list of all work items without any state filter you can use the \"All\" tag.\n\n\nSome of work items are automatically tagged with \"Watched\" by process design and you can remove if no longer needed.\n\n\nAdditionally you can use your custom defined tags to filter work items.\n\n\nWork Item\n\n\nWork Item is a step in workflow, while workflow advances in process every step creates a new work item that assigned to people or system. Work item may be assigned to one or more user. Until it's complete by a user stays in user's work list. Some of work items are assigned to system to execute automated tasks and does not have interactive action with any user.\n\n\nDocument Archive\n\n\nDocument archive stores the all document based data. Documents may be generated by processes or manually imported by people. All of documents may contain one or more attached file and search profile. You can search documents by full text index or specific search fields.\n\n\nLife Cycle\n\n\nThis page explains the life cycle of creating an application in the Workrunner. Applications are created and run with agile methodology steps in the Workrunner.\n\n\nAgile methodology in the Workrunner uses adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning and there is clarity on future tasks only in respect of what features need to be developed. There is feature driven development and the Workrunner adapts to the changing product requirements dynamically.The product is tested very frequently, through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of any major failures in future.\n\n\nThe following steps describe how to work agile methodology life cycle in the Workrunner.\n\n\nRequirements Analysis\n\n\nRequirements analysis step starts to design process diagram in the Workrunner. Task is created for each process step in the diagram and task links are created.Process diagram shows an application working digit.\n\n\nSecond step is data model design. Also data models define how data is connected to each other. Process is divided section, sub section and elements after to define features for each elements in the data model.\n\n\nDesign\n\n\nDesign step corresponds to form design in the Workrunner. Form design section is connected data model of elements and to utilize elements for create form content. \n\n\nImplementation and Testing\n\n\nImplementation and testing steps are actualized at the same time in the Workrunner. The following steps explain how to test and implement process.\n\n\n\n\nSend form to user. \n\n\nIf process run, you will see task in to your inbox. When you open task, you will see designed form. \n\n\nEnter information in to form, click action button.\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\n\n\nEvolution step is last loop structure in the Workrunner. When faced any process problem, it is solved by using life cycle steps without stopping the process.",

Main and the sub workflows use the same XML. When this option is selected on the module page, a form comes to hand, consisting of the options below.\n\n\nPool\n\n\nSelect a pool to trigger a task (sub workflow) from.\n\n\nTask\n\n\nWhen pool is selected, its tasks are listed in this dropdown. Select one to trigger.\n\n\nMode\n\n\nThere are 3 options listed in the dropdown; \n\n\nCreate child instances and continue\n\nWith this option, after the sub workflows are created, the main workflow continues to the next task(s).\n\n\nSynchronize child instances and continue\n\nIf you choose this option, the sub workflows created can be synchronized by the main workflow. With this synchronization, whenever the main workflow's parent task is visited again, all related sub workflows can be updated according to the XML. For example assume that you created 2 sub workflows and then deleted one of them from the XML. When main workflow returns to that creator task, the sub workflow related with the one that was deleted from the XML will be terminated.\n\n\nWait for all childs to complete\n\nAll of the sub workflows must be completed in order for the main workflow to continue to next task(s). Until all its children is completed, main task waits on Join state.\n\n\nXPath\n\n\nUse this text box to specify the node name to be regarded to create the sub workflows with.\n\n\nCondition\n\n\nYou can indicate a condition to specialize the node selected on the previous option.\n\n\nRow Id XPath\n\n\nIf you are going to use the synchronize mode, write the name of your Id node which is located under your XPath, in order it to be checked to update the sub workflows properly.\n\n\nSync Data XPath\n\n\nIf you wrote down a row id xpath above but yet it is not enough to indicate the updated sub workflow's data on the XML, specify another node for synchronization. For example if one of your sub workflows has a AssignedTo node in its XML which holds the assignee information, changing this assignee information to someone else might have an effect on the related subworkflow, like to reassign the task to the new person.",

It is built on XPath expressions so one that wants to use XQuery must know how to use XPath. \n\n\nXQuery grounds on the five expressions whose acronym is FLWOR (pronounced \"flower\").\n\n\n\n\nFor\n - selects a sequence of nodes\n\n\nLet\n - binds a sequence to a variable\n\n\nWhere\n - filters the nodes\n\n\nOrder by\n - sorts the nodes\n\n\nReturn\n - what to return (gets evaluated once for every node)\n\n\n\n\nWith these expressions (not necessarily with all of them) one can query any XML data.\n\n\nBesides the main features of XQuery there is an extension called XQuery Update Facility which introduces some useful features to XQuery.\n\n\nThe XQuery Update Facility is a relatively small extension of the XQuery language which provides convenient means of modifying XML documents or data. As of March 14, 2008, the \nXQuery Update Facility specification\n has become a \"Candidate Recommendation\", which means it is now pretty stable.\n\n\nWhy an update facility in XML Query?\n \nThe answer seems obvious, yet after all the XQuery language itself - or its cousin XSLT2 - is powerful enough to write any transformation of an XML tree. Therefore a simple \"store\" or \"put\" function, applied to the result of such transformation, could seem sufficient to achieve any kind of database update operation. Well, perhaps. In practice this would be neither very natural, convenient, nor very efficient (such an approach requires storing back the whole document and makes optimizing very difficult). So as we will see the little complexity added by XQuery Update seems quite worth the effort.\n\n\nThe Instructions below give a quick yet comprehensive practical introduction to the XQuery Update extension, while highlighting some of its peculiarities.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n the reader is presumed to have some acquaintance with XML Query and its Data Model (the abstract representation of XML data, involving nodes of six types: document, element, attribute, text, comment, processing-instruction).\n\n\nProcessing models\n\n\nThere are two main ways of using the update primitives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect update of an XML database:\n\n\nIn the examples in previous topic, nodes belonging to a database are selected then updated.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe XQUF notion of a database is very general: it means any collection of XML documents or well-formed fragments (trees).\n\n\n\n\nXQuery Update does not define precisely the protocol by which updating operations are applied to a database. This is left to implementations. For example transaction and isolation issues are not addressed by the specifications.\n\n\nIt is simply assumed that updates are applied to the database when the execution of a script completes. The language is designed in such a way that semantics of the \"apply-updates\" operation are precisely defined, yet as much space as possible is left for optimization by database implementations.   \n\n\nPoints to be noticed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates are not applied immediately as the updating expression executes. Instead they are accumulated into a \"Pending Update List\". At some point at the end of the execution, Pending Updates are applied all at once, and the database is updated atomically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA noticeable consequence is that updates are not visible during the script execution, but only after. This can be fairly off-putting for a developer. It also has a definite influence on programming style. We will see later examples of this effect and how to cope with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same expression can update several documents at once. The examples above could be applied to any collection of documents instead of the single document doc.xml. Example:\n\nfor $name in collection(\n/allbooks\n)//CATEGORY/NAME\nreturn rename node $name as CATEGORY_NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransforms without side effects:\n\n\nThe XQUF has a supplementary operation called transform which updates a copy of an existing node, without modifying the original, and returns the transformed tree.\n\n\nThe following example produces a transformed version of doc.xml without actually touching the original document:\n\n\ncopy\n \n$d\n \n:=\n \ndoc\n(\ndoc.xml\n)\n \n\nmodify\n \n(\n\n  \nfor\n \n$n\n \nin\n \n$d\n//CATEGORY/NAME\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrename\n \nnode\n \n$n\n \nas\n \nCATEGORY_NAME\n\n\n)\n\n\nreturn\n \n$d\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that within the modify clause, XQUF forbids modifying the original version of copied trees (here the document doc.xml itself); only the copied trees can be modified. \nThe following expression would cause an error:\n\n\ncopy\n \n$d\n \n:=\n \ndoc\n(\ndoc.xml\n)\n\n\n\nmodify\n \n(\n\n  \nfor\n \n$n\n \nin\n \ndoc\n(\ndoc.xml\n)\n//CATEGORY/NAME(: *** wrong *** :)\n\n  \nreturn\n \nrename\n \nnode\n \n$n\n \nas\n \nCATEGORY_NAME\n\n\n)\n\n\nreturn\n \n$d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimitive operations\n\n\nThe XQuery Update Facility (abbreviated as XQUF) provides five basic operations acting upon XML nodes:\n\n\n\n\ninsert\n one or several nodes inside/after/before a specified node\n\n\ndelete\n one or several nodes\n\n\nreplace a node\n (and all its descendants if it is an element) by a sequence of nodes.\n\n\nreplace the contents\n (children) of a node with a sequence of nodes, or the \nvalue\n of a node with a string value.\n\n\nrename\n a node (applicable to elements, attributes and processing instructions) without affecting its contents or attributes.\n\n\n\n\nCombination of update primitives with the base language\n\nTypically, we use some plain query to select the node(s) we want to update, then we apply update operations on those nodes. This is similar to the \nSQL UPDATE... WHERE...\n instruction.\n\n\nExample 1:\n in a document doc.xml, rename all elements children of a \nCATEGORY\n as \nCATEGORY_NAME\n:\n\n\nfor\n \n$name\n \nin\n \ndoc\n(\ndoc.xml\n)\n//CATEGORY/NAME   (: selection :)\n\n\nreturn\n \nrename\n \nnode\n \n$name\n \nas\n \nCATEGORY_NAME\n    \n(\n:\n \nupdate\n \n:\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n for all \nBOOK\n elements which have an attribute Id, replace that attribute with a child \nID\n in first position:\n\n\nfor\n \n$idattr\n \nin\n \ndoc\n(\ndata.xml\n)\n//BOOK/@Id     (: selection :)\n\n\nreturn\n \n(\n           \n   \ndelete\n \nnode\n \n$idattr\n,\n                      \n(\n:\n \nupdate\n \n1\n \n:\n)\n\n   \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nID\n{\nstring\n(\n$idattr\n)}\n/ID\n    (: update 2 :)\n\n      \nas\n \nfirst\n \ninto\n \n$idattr\n/\n..\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the latter script the following fragment\n\n\nBOOK\n \nId=\n0025\nsome content\n/BOOK\n \n\n\n\n\nwould be modified into:\n\n\nBOOK\nID\n0025\n/ID\nsome content\n/BOOK\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the second example, it is completely irrelevant whether the \ndelete\n is written after or before the \ninsert node\n. This surprising property of XQUF is explained below.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some restrictions in the way the 5 updating operations can mix with the base XQuery language. XQUF makes a distinction between Updating Expressions (which encompass update primitives) and non-updating expressions. Updating Expressions cannot appear anywhere. This topic will be explained in more detail.\n\n\ndelete nodes\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\ndelete node location\n\n\ndelete nodes location\n\n\nThe expression location represents a sequence of nodes which are marked for deletion (the actual number of nodes does not need to match the keyword node or nodes).\n\n\ninsert nodes\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\ninsert (node|nodes) items into path\n\n\ninsert (node|nodes) items as first into Path\n\n\ninsert (node|nodes) items as last into Path\n\n\ninsert (node|nodes) items before Path\n\n\ninsert (node|nodes) items after Path\n\n\nThe expression Path must point to a single target node.\n\n\nThe expression items must yield a sequence of items to insert relatively to the target node.\n\n\nNotice that even though the keyword \nnode\n or \nnodes\n are used, the inserted items can be non-node items. What happens actually is that the string values of non-node items are concatenated to form text nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf either form of into is used, then the target node must be an element or a document. The items to insert are treated exactly as the contents of an element constructor.\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an empty element \nCONT/\n,\n\ninsert nodes (attribute A { 5.4 }, \nchild1/\n, \ntext\n, 2 to 4)\ninto $target\n\n\n\nyields:\n\n\nCONT\n \nA=\n5.4\nchild1/\ntext 2 3 4\n/CONT\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore the same rules as in constructors apply: item order is preserved, a space is inserted between consecutive non-node items, inserted nodes are copied first, attribute nodes are not allowed after other item types, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the keywords \nas first\n (resp. as \nlast\n) are used, the items are inserted before (resp. after) any existing children of the element.\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element \nparent\nkid/\n/parent\n\n\ninsert node \nelder/\n as first into $target\n\n\n\n\nyields:\n\n\nparent\nelder/\nkid/\n/parent\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the only keyword into is used, the resulting position is implementation dependent. It is only guaranteed that as first into and as last into have priority over into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf before or after are used, any node type is allowed for the target node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes are a special case: regardless of the before or after keyword used, attributes are always inserted into the parent element of the target. The order of inserted attributes is unspecified. Name conflicts can generate errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreplace node\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\nreplace node location with items\n\n\nThe expression location must point to a single target node.\n\n\nThe expression items must yield a sequence of items that will replace the target node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for document and attribute node types, the target node can be replaced by any sequence of items. The replacing items are treated exactly as the contents of an element/document constructor.\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element \nP\nkid/\nsome text\n/P\n,\n\n\nreplace node $target/kid with \nhere is\n\n\n\n\n\nyields:\n\n\nP\nhere is some text\n/P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes are a special case: they can only be replaced by an attribute node. Name conflicts can generate errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreplace node value\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\nreplace value of node location with items\n\n\nHere the identity of the target node is preserved. Only its value or contents (for an element or a document) is replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the target is an element or a document node, then all its former children are removed and replaced. The replacing items are treated exactly as the contents of a text constructor (so all node items are replaced by their string-value).\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element \nP\nkid/\nsome text\n/P\n,\n\n\nreplace value of node $target with (\ntext\nlet\ns count: \n/text\n, 1 to 3, \n...\n)\n\n\n\n\nyields:\n\n\nP\nlet\ns count: 1 2 3 ...\n/P\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the element contents are replaced by a text node whose value is the concatenation of the string values of replacing items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the target node is a leaf node (attribute, text, comment, processing-instruction) then its string value is replaced by the concatenation of the string values of replacing items.\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element \nP order=\nold\nsome text\n/P\n,\n\n\nreplace value of node $target/@order with (1 to 3, \nell\n...\n/ell\n)\n\n\n\n\nyields:\n\n\nP\n \norder=\n1 2 3...\nsome text\n/P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrename node\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\nrename node location as name-expression\n\n\nThe expression location must point to a single target element, attribute or processing-instruction.\n\n\nThe expression name-expression must yield a single QName or string item.\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element \nCONT B=\nb\nsome text\n/CONT\n\n\nrename node $target as qName(\nsome.namespace\n, \nCONTAINER\n),\nrename node $target/B as \nNEWB\n\n\n\nyields:\n\nns1:CONTAINER\n \nNEWB=\nb\n \nxmlns:ns1=\nsome.namespace\nsome text\n/ns1:CONTAINER\n\n\n\n\ntransform\n\n\nSyntax:\n\n\ncopy\n \n$var\n \n:=\n \nnode\n \n[,\n \n$var2\n \n:=\n \nnode2\n \n...]\n\n\nmodify\n \nupdating\n-\nexpression\n\n\nreturn\n \nexpression\n\n\n\n\n\nEach node expression is copied (at least virtually) and bound to a variable.\n\n\nThe updating-expression contains or invokes one or several update primitives. These primitives are allowed to act only upon the copied XML trees, pointed by the bound variables. Therefore the transform expression has no side effect.\n\n\nBefore the return expression is evaluated, all updates are applied to the copied trees. Typically the return expression would be a bound variable, or a node constructor involving the bound variables, so it will yield the updated tree(s).\n\n\nFor example if \n$target\n points to an element\n\n\ncopy\n \n$target\n \n:=\n \nCONT\n \nid\n=\n001\nsome\n \ntext\n/CONT\n\n\nmodify\n \n(\n\n   \nrename\n \nnode\n \n$target\n \nas\n \nSECTION\n,\n\n   \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nTITLE\nThe\n \ntitle\n/TITLE\n as first into $target\n\n\n)\n\n\nreturn\n \nelement\n \nDOC\n \n{\n \n$target\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nreturns:\n\nDOC\nSECTION\n \nid=\n001\nTITLE\nThe title\n/TITLE\nsome text\n/SECTION\n/DOC\n\n\n\n\nInvisible update problem\n\n\nThe fact that updates are applied only at the end of a script execution has two consequences on programming, one disturbing, one pleasant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disturbing consequence is that you don't see your updates until the end, therefore you cannot build on your changes to make other changes.\n\n\nAn example: suppose you have elements named PERSON. Inside a \nPERSON\n there can be a list of \nBID\n elements (representing bids made by this person), and you want the \nBID\n elements to be wrapped in a \nBIDS\n element. But initially the \nPERSON\n has no \nBIDS\n child.\n\n\nInitially:\n\nPERSON\n \nid=\np0103\n\n  \nNAME\nJane\n/NAME\n\n\n/PERSON\n\n\n\n\nWe want to insert \nBID id=\nb0022\ndata\n/BID\n to obtain:\n\n\nPERSON\n \nid=\np0103\n\n  \nNAME\nJane\n/NAME\n\n  \nBIDS\n\n     \nBID\n \nid=\nb0022\ndata\n/BID\n\n  \nBIDS\n\n\n/PERSON\n\n\n\n\n\nClassically, for example using the \nDOM\n, we would proceed in two steps:\n\n\n\n\nIf there is no \nBIDS\n element inside \nPERSON\n, then create one\n\n\nthen insert the \nBID\n element inside the \nBIDS\n element\n\n\n\n\nIn XQuery Update this would (incorrectly) be written like this:\n\n\ndeclare\n \nupdating\n \nfunction\n \ninsert\n-\nbid\n(\n$person\n,\n \n$bid\n)\n\n\n{\n\n  \nif\n(\nempty\n(\n$person\n/\nBIDS\n))\n\n    \nthen\n \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nBIDS\n/\n \ninto\n \n$person\n\n    \nelse\n \n(),\n\n  \ninsert\n \nnode\n \n$bid\n \nas\n \nlast\n \ninto\n \n$person\n/\nBIDS\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nDon't try that: it won't work! Why?\n\nBecause the \nBIDS\n element will be created only at the very end, therefore the instruction insert ... as last into \n$person/BIDS\n will not find any node matching \n$person/BIDS\n, hence throw an execution error.\n\n\n\n\nSo what is a correct way of doing ? We need a self-sufficient solution for each of the two cases:   \n\n\ndeclare\n \nupdating\n \nfunction\n \ninsert\n-\nbid\n(\n$person\n,\n \n$bid\n)\n\n\n{\n\n \nif\n(\nempty\n(\n$person\n/\nBIDS\n))\n\n   \nthen\n \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nBIDS\n{\n$bids\n}\n/BIDS\n into $person\n\n   \nelse\n \ninsert\n \nnode\n \n$bid\n \nas\n \nlast\n \ninto\n \n$person\n/\nBIDS\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pleasant consequence is that the document(s) on which you are working are stable during execution of your script. You can rest assured that you are not sawing the branch you are sitting on. For example you can quietly write:\n\n\nfor\n \n$x\n \nin\n \ncollection\n(...)\n//X\n\n\nreturn\n \ndelete\n \nnode\n \n$x\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is perfectly predictable and won't stop prematurely. Or you can replicate an element after itself without risking looping forever:\n\n\nfor\n \n$x\n \nin\n \ncollection\n(...)\n//X\n\n\nreturn\n \ninsert\n \nnode\n \n$x\n \nafter\n \n$x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Updates and Non-updating Expressions\n\n\nUpdating Expressions are XQuery expressions that encompass the 5 updating primitives.\n\n\nThere are rules about mixing Updating and Non-updating Expressions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let us remember that Updating Expressions do not return any value. They simply add an update request to a list. Eventually the updates in the list are applied at the end of a script execution (or at the end of the \nmodify\n clause in the case of the \ntransform\n expression).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Expressions are therefore not allowed in places where a meaningful value is expected. For example the condition of a if, the right hand-side of a \nlet :=\n, the in part of a \nfor\n and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing Updating and Non-updating Expressions is not allowed in a sequence (the comma operator). Though technically feasible, it would not make much sense to mix expressions that return a value and expressions that don't remember that the sequence operator returns the concatenation of the sequences returned by its components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfn:error()\n function and the empty sequence () are special as they can appear both in Updating and in non-updating expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same way, the branches of a \nif clause\n or a \ntypeswitch\n must be consistent: both Updating or both Non-updating. If both branches are Updating then the if itself is considered Updating, and conversely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the body of a function is an Updating Expression, then the function must be declared with the \nupdating\n keyword. Example:\n\n\ndeclare\n \nupdating\n \nfunction\n \ninsert\n-\nid\n(\n$elem\n,\n \n$id\n-\nvalue\n)\n \n{\n\n   \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nattribute\n \nid\n \n{\n \n$id\n-\nvalue\n \n}\n \ninto\n \n$elem\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nA call to such a function is itself considered an Updating Expression. Logically enough, an updating function returns no value and therefore is not allowed to declare a return type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrders and conflicts\n\n\nAnother consequence of the \"Pending Updates\" mechanism is that the order in which updates are specified is not important. In the following example you can without any issue delete the attribute Id (pointed by \n$idattr\n), and after use \n$idattr/..\n (the parent ITEM element) for inserting! Or you could insert first and delete after.\n\n\nfor\n \n$idattr\n \nin\n \ndoc\n(\ndata.xml\n)\n//ITEM/@Id   (: selection :)\n\n\nreturn\n \n(\n                                   \n(\n:\n \nupdates\n \n:\n)\n\n   \ndelete\n \nnode\n \n$idattr\n,\n\n   \ninsert\n \nnode\n \nID\n{\nstring\n(\n$idattr\n)}\n/ID\n as first into $idattr/\n..\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because of that, some conflicting changes can produce unpredictable results. For example two \nrename\n of the same node are conflicting, because we do not know in which order they would be applied. Other ambiguous operations: two \nreplace\n of the same node, two \nreplace value\n (or contents) of the same node.\n\n\nThe XQUF specifications take care of forbidding such ambiguous updates. An error is generated (during the apply-updates stage) when such a conflict is detected.\n\n\nA bit ironically, no error is generated for meaningless but non ambiguous conflicts, for example both renaming and deleting the same node (\ndelete node\n has priority over other operations).",

XQuery grounds on the five expressions whose acronym is FLWOR (pronounced \"flower\").   For  - selects a sequence of nodes  Let  - binds a sequence to a variable  Where  - filters the nodes  Order by  - sorts the nodes  Return  - what to return (gets evaluated once for every node)   With these expressions (not necessarily with all of them) one can query any XML data.  Besides the main features of XQuery there is an extension called XQuery Update Facility which introduces some useful features to XQuery.  The XQuery Update Facility is a relatively small extension of the XQuery language which provides convenient means of modifying XML documents or data. As of March 14, 2008, the  XQuery Update Facility specification  has become a \"Candidate Recommendation\", which means it is now pretty stable.  Why an update facility in XML Query?  \nThe answer seems obvious, yet after all the XQuery language itself - or its cousin XSLT2 - is powerful enough to write any transformation of an XML tree. Therefore a simple \"store\" or \"put\" function, applied to the result of such transformation, could seem sufficient to achieve any kind of database update operation. Well, perhaps. In practice this would be neither very natural, convenient, nor very efficient (such an approach requires storing back the whole document and makes optimizing very difficult). So as we will see the little complexity added by XQuery Update seems quite worth the effort.  The Instructions below give a quick yet comprehensive practical introduction to the XQuery Update extension, while highlighting some of its peculiarities.  Prerequisites:  the reader is presumed to have some acquaintance with XML Query and its Data Model (the abstract representation of XML data, involving nodes of six types: document, element, attribute, text, comment, processing-instruction).",

Note  The XQUF notion of a database is very general: it means any collection of XML documents or well-formed fragments (trees).   XQuery Update does not define precisely the protocol by which updating operations are applied to a database. This is left to implementations. For example transaction and isolation issues are not addressed by the specifications.  It is simply assumed that updates are applied to the database when the execution of a script completes. The language is designed in such a way that semantics of the \"apply-updates\" operation are precisely defined, yet as much space as possible is left for optimization by database implementations.     Points to be noticed:    Updates are not applied immediately as the updating expression executes. Instead they are accumulated into a \"Pending Update List\". At some point at the end of the execution, Pending Updates are applied all at once, and the database is updated atomically.    A noticeable consequence is that updates are not visible during the script execution, but only after. This can be fairly off-putting for a developer. It also has a definite influence on programming style. We will see later examples of this effect and how to cope with it.    The same expression can update several documents at once. The examples above could be applied to any collection of documents instead of the single document doc.xml. Example: for $name in collection( /allbooks )//CATEGORY/NAME\nreturn rename node $name as CATEGORY_NAME      Transforms without side effects:  The XQUF has a supplementary operation called transform which updates a copy of an existing node, without modifying the original, and returns the transformed tree.  The following example produces a transformed version of doc.xml without actually touching the original document:  copy   $d   :=   doc ( doc.xml )   modify   ( \n   for   $n   in   $d //CATEGORY/NAME \n   return   rename   node   $n   as   CATEGORY_NAME  )  return   $d   Notice that within the modify clause, XQUF forbids modifying the original version of copied trees (here the document doc.xml itself); only the copied trees can be modified. \nThe following expression would cause an error:  copy   $d   :=   doc ( doc.xml )  modify   ( \n   for   $n   in   doc ( doc.xml ) //CATEGORY/NAME(: *** wrong *** :) \n   return   rename   node   $n   as   CATEGORY_NAME  )  return   $d",

Combination of update primitives with the base language \nTypically, we use some plain query to select the node(s) we want to update, then we apply update operations on those nodes. This is similar to the  SQL UPDATE... WHERE...  instruction.  Example 1:  in a document doc.xml, rename all elements children of a  CATEGORY  as  CATEGORY_NAME :  for   $name   in   doc ( doc.xml ) //CATEGORY/NAME   (: selection :)  return   rename   node   $name   as   CATEGORY_NAME      ( :   update   : )   Example 2:  for all  BOOK  elements which have an attribute Id, replace that attribute with a child  ID  in first position:  for   $idattr   in   doc ( data.xml ) //BOOK/@Id     (: selection :)  return   (            \n    delete   node   $idattr ,                        ( :   update   1   : ) \n    insert   node   ID { string ( $idattr )} /ID     (: update 2 :) \n       as   first   into   $idattr / ..  )   With the latter script the following fragment  BOOK   Id= 0025 some content /BOOK    would be modified into:  BOOK ID 0025 /ID some content /BOOK     Note  In the second example, it is completely irrelevant whether the  delete  is written after or before the  insert node . This surprising property of XQUF is explained below.   There are some restrictions in the way the 5 updating operations can mix with the base XQuery language.

The expression items must yield a sequence of items to insert relatively to the target node.  Notice that even though the keyword  node  or  nodes  are used, the inserted items can be non-node items. What happens actually is that the string values of non-node items are concatenated to form text nodes.    If either form of into is used, then the target node must be an element or a document. The items to insert are treated exactly as the contents of an element constructor.

The updating-expression contains or invokes one or several update primitives. These primitives are allowed to act only upon the copied XML trees, pointed by the bound variables. Therefore the transform expression has no side effect.  Before the return expression is evaluated, all updates are applied to the copied trees. Typically the return expression would be a bound variable, or a node constructor involving the bound variables, so it will yield the updated tree(s).

            "text": "The fact that updates are applied only at the end of a script execution has two consequences on programming, one disturbing, one pleasant:    The disturbing consequence is that you don't see your updates until the end, therefore you cannot build on your changes to make other changes.  An example: suppose you have elements named PERSON. Inside a  PERSON  there can be a list of  BID  elements (representing bids made by this person), and you want the  BID  elements to be wrapped in a  BIDS  element. But initially the  PERSON  has no  BIDS  child.  Initially: PERSON   id= p0103 \n   NAME Jane /NAME  /PERSON   We want to insert  BID id= b0022 data /BID  to obtain:  PERSON   id= p0103 \n   NAME Jane /NAME \n   BIDS \n      BID   id= b0022 data /BID \n   BIDS  /PERSON   Classically, for example using the  DOM , we would proceed in two steps:   If there is no  BIDS  element inside  PERSON , then create one  then insert the  BID  element inside the  BIDS  element   In XQuery Update this would (incorrectly) be written like this:  declare   updating   function   insert - bid ( $person ,   $bid )  { \n   if ( empty ( $person / BIDS )) \n     then   insert   node   BIDS /   into   $person \n     else   (), \n   insert   node   $bid   as   last   into   $person / BIDS  }    Info  Don't try that: it won't work! Why? \nBecause the  BIDS  element will be created only at the very end, therefore the instruction insert ... as last into  $person/BIDS  will not find any node matching  $person/BIDS , hence throw an execution error.   So what is a correct way of doing ? We need a self-sufficient solution for each of the two cases:     declare   updating   function   insert - bid ( $person ,   $bid )  { \n  if ( empty ( $person / BIDS )) \n    then   insert   node   BIDS { $bids } /BIDS  into $person \n    else   insert   node   $bid   as   last   into   $person / BIDS  }     The pleasant consequence is that the document(s) on which you are working are stable during execution of your script. You can rest assured that you are not sawing the branch you are sitting on. For example you can quietly write:  for   $x   in   collection (...) //X  return   delete   node   $x   This is perfectly predictable and won't stop prematurely. Or you can replicate an element after itself without risking looping forever:  for   $x   in   collection (...) //X  return   insert   node   $x   after   $x",

            "text": "Updating Expressions are XQuery expressions that encompass the 5 updating primitives.  There are rules about mixing Updating and Non-updating Expressions:    First of all, let us remember that Updating Expressions do not return any value. They simply add an update request to a list. Eventually the updates in the list are applied at the end of a script execution (or at the end of the  modify  clause in the case of the  transform  expression).    Updating Expressions are therefore not allowed in places where a meaningful value is expected. For example the condition of a if, the right hand-side of a  let := , the in part of a  for  and so on.    Mixing Updating and Non-updating Expressions is not allowed in a sequence (the comma operator). Though technically feasible, it would not make much sense to mix expressions that return a value and expressions that don't remember that the sequence operator returns the concatenation of the sequences returned by its components.    The  fn:error()  function and the empty sequence () are special as they can appear both in Updating and in non-updating expressions.    In the same way, the branches of a  if clause  or a  typeswitch  must be consistent: both Updating or both Non-updating. If both branches are Updating then the if itself is considered Updating, and conversely.    If the body of a function is an Updating Expression, then the function must be declared with the  updating  keyword. Example:  declare   updating   function   insert - id ( $elem ,   $id - value )   { \n    insert   node   attribute   id   {   $id - value   }   into   $elem  }   A call to such a function is itself considered an Updating Expression. Logically enough, an updating function returns no value and therefore is not allowed to declare a return type.",

In the following example you can without any issue delete the attribute Id (pointed by  $idattr ), and after use  $idattr/..  (the parent ITEM element) for inserting! Or you could insert first and delete after.  for   $idattr   in   doc ( data.xml ) //ITEM/@Id   (: selection :)  return   (                                     ( :   updates   : ) \n    delete   node   $idattr , \n    insert   node   ID { string ( $idattr )} /ID  as first into $idattr/ ..  )   But because of that, some conflicting changes can produce unpredictable results. For example two  rename  of the same node are conflicting, because we do not know in which order they would be applied. Other ambiguous operations: two  replace  of the same node, two  replace value  (or contents) of the same node.  The XQUF specifications take care of forbidding such ambiguous updates. An error is generated (during the apply-updates stage) when such a conflict is detected.  A bit ironically, no error is generated for meaningless but non ambiguous conflicts, for example both renaming and deleting the same node ( delete node  has priority over other operations).",

            "text": "Workrunner performs most of heavy operations in background to achieve scalable and high performance output. These background operations are executed by Workrunner service agent without any user interaction.\n\n\nWhen a new process started by user, workflow state is recorded in database without any further processing and creates a couple of background jobs. Service agents pulls the jobs from queue and try to process in background. If an error occurs while processing job, transaction state is rollbacked and error state is reported to the system administrators. When administrator resolves the issue, job re-queued in system from job manager to process again. Some of errors are automatically recovered by system and queued again with time delay.\n\n\n \n\n\nService agents uses multiple threads and also can be deployed to any number of hardware instances to perform parallel execution. Jobs are executed in order of priority and a single service agent can complete 600 job per minute for basic workflow operations. This number is highly depends on job definition and hardware specifications.\n\n\nJob Details\n\n\nEach job has following properties;\n\n\nType\n\n\nType of job. \n\n\nCreated At\n\n\nDate and time of job is created.\n\n\nDelete After\n\n\nDate and time of job to delete.\n\n\nStarted At\n\n\nStart date and time of job.\n\n\nCompleted At\n\n\nCompletion date and time of job.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nDuration of execution if job is completed or duration of wait time in queue.\n\n\nScore\n\n\nCalculated priority score. This value is calculated from job type priority and workflow instance priority.\n\n\nState\n\n\nState of job. Can be one of following values; Waiting, Processing, Error, Completed, Aborted.\n\n\nState Transition\n\n\nEvery job is created in \"Waiting\" state.\n\n\nWhen a service agent pulls the job from queue, agent locks the job and changes to \"Processing\" state.\n\n\nIf job is successfully completed state changes to \"Completed\".\n\n\nIf job generates an error, state changes to \"Error\" and system administrator is notified. Some of job errors are automatically handled. For example e-mail sending job errors are ignored and re-scheduled and state changes to \"Waiting\" to try again later. If maximum try count limit exceeded state is changed to \"Error\" or \"Aborted\" by configuration settings.\n\n\nFor \"Aborted\" and \"Completed\" states job is automatically deleted from system if \"Delete After\" date is passed.\n\n\n \n\n\nJob Log\n\n\nEach job contains a log about detailed information of what is performed in background. Each log line has a in log level like Debug,Information,Warning,Error.\n\n\n \n\n\nJob Types\n\n\nWorkflow Jobs\n\n\nScheduled Task\n\n\nTime based generic job. This job usually creates another jobs if any action required.\n\n\nTask Evaluation\n\n\nCreated when initiate type workflow task scheduled to start periodically. Created by Scheduled Task for per task definition. You can find more detail in \nTask Evaluation\n section. \n\n\nWork Item Evaluation\n\n\nCreated when normal type workflow task scheduled to check periodically. Created by Scheduled Task for per work item instance. You can find more detail in \nTask Evaluation\n section.\n\n\nWork Item Processing\n\n\nCreated when a user or system complete a work item. This job advances to next step in workflow and executes the scripts in workflow, calculates the role scripts to assign to task.\n\n\nDeadlined Work Item\n\n\nCreated when a work item's deadline occurs. This job is similar to \"Work Item Processing\" job but created when deadline date is missed.\n\n\nWork Item Reminder\n\n\nCreated when a task reminder need to be sent.\n\n\nXml Database Jobs\n\n\nForm Data Xml Database Replication\n\n\nCreated when workflow data need to be replicated on xml database.

Score  Calculated priority score. This value is calculated from job type priority and workflow instance priority.  State  State of job. Can be one of following values; Waiting, Processing, Error, Completed, Aborted.  State Transition  Every job is created in \"Waiting\" state.  When a service agent pulls the job from queue, agent locks the job and changes to \"Processing\" state.  If job is successfully completed state changes to \"Completed\".  If job generates an error, state changes to \"Error\" and system administrator is notified. Some of job errors are automatically handled. For example e-mail sending job errors are ignored and re-scheduled and state changes to \"Waiting\" to try again later.
