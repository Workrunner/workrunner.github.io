# Overview


Workrunner BPMS is designed to provide a single comprehensive web interface that encompasses all facets of a process lifecycle – analysis, modeling, simulation and continuous enhancement – and to eliminate the need for people to learn and use multiple different systems and applications. With a flexible architecture, it allows for rapid and frequent modifications to active processes and makes it easy to migrate older applications into service-oriented structures.
Organization

## Organization

Organization in the Workrunner BPMS has a management structure that determines relationships between the different units, groups and the members. Also it assigns roles, responsibilities, and authority to carry out different tasks. 
Process Modelling

## Process Modelling

Process modelling is the analytical representation and illustration in the Workrunner BPMS. Process modeling is used to map out a system’s current processes to create a baseline for process improvements and to design future processes with those improvements incorporated. A process model is completely an anticipation of what the process will look like.
Background Jobs

## Background Jobs

A background job is a the Workrunner job that runs behind the scenes and without any user interaction. Typical tasks for these processes include logging, system monitoring, scheduling, and user notification.
