## Overview

Emakin BPMS is designed to provide a single comprehensive web interface that encompasses all facets of a process lifecycle – analysis, modeling, simulation and continuous enhancement – and to eliminate the need for people to learn and use multiple different systems and applications. With a flexible architecture, it allows for rapid and frequent modifications to active processes and makes it easy to migrate older applications into service-oriented structures.
Organization

Organization in the Emakin BPMS has a management structure that determines relationships between the different units, groups and the members. Also it assigns roles, responsibilities, and authority to carry out different tasks. 
Process Modelling

Process modelling is the analytical representation and illustration in the Emakin BPMS. Process modeling is used to map out a system’s current processes to create a baseline for process improvements and to design future processes with those improvements incorporated. A process model is completely an anticipation of what the process will look like.
Background Jobs

A background job is a the Emakin job that runs behind the scenes and without any user interaction. Typical tasks for these processes include logging, system monitoring, scheduling, and user notification.
